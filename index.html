                <p>
                    The idea for bull-flagger came from a friend of mine who was always looking for trends in the stock market.
                    He needed an app that could filter stocks based on their rate of consolidation in past months, and I told him I could make it happen.
                    I learned how to use BeautifulSoup, and used it to scrape yahoo finances for past daily stock prices, and wrote a script that runs daily to scrape new data and put it in my database.
                    I wrote the front end of the app in React, and have a backend node server running with express and mongoose that pulls stocks based on search criteria.

                <p>
                    I decided to make SMPL simply as a learning project. I figured I could make a website similar to 4chan, and wanted to see how I could get it done.
                    For the front end I used React, and I decided to not use any UI libraries in order to strengthen my CSS skills. I used Node + express + mongoose as my backend.
                    I used MongoDB for my database, and it was sufficient until I needed to start hosting images. I originally was storing them in the database as binary data, but after a bit of 
                    reading on the subject realized that's not the best practice. I decided to store any files in an AWS S3 bucket, and store the key for the link to the photo in the corresponding
                    databse document. The project is still ongoing, with most updates being optimizations and UI polishing.
